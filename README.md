# Flower-Type-Classifer-using-OpenVINO
This project demonstrates the use of OpenVINO (Open Visual Inference and Neural Network Optimization) toolkit to create a flower type classifier. The model is trained to identify five different types of flowers: daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, and tulips.

# Usage
* Install OpenVINO toolkit and required dependencies.
* Download and compile the model using the OpenVINO Core API.
* Use the compiled model to classify flower types from uploaded images.
